# A Responsive WebCV Project

This is a person project to continue to develop frontend and angular.js skills.  This is a responsive WebCV that will feature my work experience, showcase my skill set, recap some of the projects I've worked on, and allow people to learn a little bit more about me!  It's built in a timeline format and has some additional javascript librarys to assist with smoothing.  As of now it's still a WIP....    

# Getting Up and Running

Since there are http calls in the angular.js code you will need Node.js to create an http-server. Once you have downloaded and installed Node.js type the following in the CMD line.  

```
npm install http-server -g
```

This will install the http-server which can then be run using the following command

```
http-server
```

Make sure you run this from your directory where the index.html resides.
